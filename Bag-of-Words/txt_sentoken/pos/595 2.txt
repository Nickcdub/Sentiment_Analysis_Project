just watching @playhearthstone run down the street to board the tram how bold for a card game to use public transit. it's so humbling to see.
just saw @playhearthstone walking faster down the street trying to casually enter the tram how bold for a card game to use public transit. it's just so humbling you to see.
only imagine @playhearthstone walking down the street to enter the tram how bold for a card game animals use public transport. it's so humbling i see.
