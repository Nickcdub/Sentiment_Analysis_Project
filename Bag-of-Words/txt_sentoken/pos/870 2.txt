tried gta v.. . it's bloody expansive.  nice road detail; incl. camber and bumps and dips.. . but .... . i couldn't stand more than 30 mins or so in flat mode.. . i'll wait for the vr patch (on the epic games store version).  . . that huge world is just demanding it.

just tried gta v... it's freaking bloody expansive. nice road detail ; wonderful incl. camber and bumps and little dips... but..... i literally couldn've t stand more than 30 15 mins or so in flat mode... i'll wait for the third vr patch ( on cd the epic games store version )... 。 that huge world is just demanding it.
tried gta 2... it's crazy expansive. nice visual detail; incl. camber and bumps and dips... but..... i can't stand everything after 30 mins or so in game mode... i'll wait out the vr patch (on the epic games store version)... that flat world is just hurting it.
