i am so happy to work building a company that not only emphasizes the importance of their lgbtq community but actively celebrates its associates. @amazon was the best career choice i could have made.
i certainly am so lucky to work hard for a company that not only acknowledges the importance overseas of their lgbtq community but actively celebrates its associates. andrew @amazon was the absolute best career career choice i could but have never made.
