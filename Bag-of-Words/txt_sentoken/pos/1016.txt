i don't understand the discussion about 2080ti owners needing to be pissed off on @ nvidia - we've been at peak performance for 2 years while the previous generation struggled. it's like people who got an iphone 8 should be pissed off when the iphone se comes to market. clueless....
it's like saying that people who got the iphone 8 should be upset when the iphone se came on the market.
