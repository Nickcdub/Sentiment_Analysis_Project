i wish @ borderlands had given me another way to apply the terror to myself that would have made it a little easier for moze to leave... i might have been more interested in the bloody harvest than getting a scary phone call.
i would very much like @ borderlands to give me another way to deal with terror that mose would be a little easier to pull off... perhaps that would make me more obsessed with bloody violence than getting a windy day call.
"i especially wish @borderlands would of given some way to apply terror to yourself that wouod have been made little easier for moze to pull off... it shall have made me more ibvested in bloody harvest
"well i myself do almost wish master @borderlands would have given another way than to apply terror to yourself that wouod have been a little much easier for moze to pull off... it may have have made to me more ibvested in this bloody harvest
"i do think babies would be provided another way to apply terror to yourself that wouod have been making little easier for kids to pull up... it should have made me more ibvested in one harvest
