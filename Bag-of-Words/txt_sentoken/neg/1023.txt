itâs like @nvidia wants us to buy @amdgaming . i wanted to buy the rtx 2080 for months sold out is seconds @nvidiageforce said they would fix this problem. they release the rtx 3090 and itâs sold out before launch... how can you be the biggest gpu supplier and not think of stock?
"i wanted to buy the rtx 2080 for months
it's like @ nvidia wants us to buy @ amdgaming. i wanted to buy the gx 2080 for months of sold out seconds @ nvidiageforce said they would solve this problem. they release the gx 3090 and it's sold out before launch... how can you be the largest supplier of gpu and not think about inventories?
"itâs like @nvidia wants us to buy @amdgaming. i want to buy the rtx 2080 for months sold out is
it â s like @nvidia still wants us guys to buy @amdgaming. i so wanted to buy the rtx 2080 card for months sold out is seconds @nvidiageforce said maybe they would fix this problem. they that release the rtx 3090 option and that it â s sold out before launch... how can now you be the 4th biggest gpu supplier and not think of stock?
itâs basically @nvidia pushing us to buy @amdgaming. i wanted to buy the rtx that for months sold out is ridiculous and said they would fix this problem. they had an rtx 3090 and itâs selling out before launch... how can you be the biggest gpu supplier and not be of us?
