@nba2k @ronnie2k iâm not spending another dime on your garbage game until you turn momentum off. every single game there is always a 12-1 or 13-2 run by the cpu
@ nba2k @ ronnie2k i won't spend a penny on your garbage game until you turn off the swing. every single game is always 12-1 or 13-2 executed by the cpu.
@ n2k @ ron2k i don't spend a penny on your wardrobe game until you turn off the pulse. every game out there is always 12-1 or 13-2 cpu-driven.
@nba2k @ronnie2k = not spending another dime on your garbage game until you lay momentum off. every single game there<unk> always a 12-1 or 13-2 run by the redskins
a @nba2k @ronnie2k and i â m not spending another dime on using your garbage game again until you turn momentum off. player every other single game but there is always a short 12 - 1 or 13 - 2 run by the cpu
@nba2k @ronnie2k iâm basically spending another dime on your garbage game until you let momentum off. every single game that goes always a two-1 x 13-2 run by the cpu
