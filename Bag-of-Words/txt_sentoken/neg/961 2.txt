@ghostrecon_uk fix your game. the behemoth is way to overpowered and hard to kill and the lens glare on your scope and drone is way over done along with how stupid difficult it is to see when it’s dark and going in and out of buildings not being able to see shit.
"@ ghostrecon _ uk fix your game. behemoth is far too overwhelming and hard to kill
@ ghostrecon _ uk will fix your game. the ghostrecon is a way to suppress and kill both lens flares on your sights and the drone - it's a fait accompli how stupid it is to see when it's dark and go in and out of buildings without seeing the shit.
@ghostrecon_uk fix your game. the behemoth is all to tough and expensive to kill plus the lens glare on your helicopter and drone is way over done along with how damn difficult it is to see when it’s dark and going in and out of buildings not being able to see shit.
@ghostrecon_uk fix your game. 4 the behemoth is not way to overpowered and way hard to kill and behind the lens is glare on your scope and the drone is way over done along with how stupid difficult it is to see when it ’ s dark over and going in and out through of buildings but not being able often to see shit.
@ghostrecon_uk fix your game. the behemoth is way fucking overpowered and easy to kill and the lens glare on your insane test engine is way over done along with how stupid difficult it is to run when it’s dead and going in and out on buildings not being able of see shit.
