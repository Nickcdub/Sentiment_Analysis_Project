@eamaddennfl why donât you create a inactivity feature online that concedes games after two delays of game by the guy youâre playing when youâre beating them senseless. nobody waits 25 min to get 50 xp points for a win when the loser is taking penalties back to their goal line
@ eamaddennfl why don't you create an inactivity feature online that grants play after two game delays by the guy you're playing if you hit them senseless? no one waits 25 minutes to get 50 points for a win when the loser brings the penalties back to their goal line.
@ eamaddennfl why don't you create an online inaction feature that hides games after two game delays by the guy you play when you beat them senselessly.
@eamaddennfl why donât you create one inactivity feature online that concedes pk after two delays of game vs the guy youâre playing when youâre beating them senseless. nobody waits 25 min & get 50 penalty points for a pk when the loser is taking penalties back to their goal line
@eamaddennfl... why games don â t let you create a clear inactivity and feature online play that concedes games after two delays of game by the guy you â re playing to when you â re beating them senseless. nobody waits 25 min longer to get 50 xp points for a win when the direct loser is taking penalties straight back to their goal line
@eamaddennfl why donât you create a inactivity server online that concedes games after two delays of game by the guy still playing when youâre fighting them senseless. guy waits 25 min to get 50 xp points for 6 win after 10 loser is taking things back to those goal line
