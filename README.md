# Sentiment_Analysis_Project
This is a Sentiment Analysis Project for TCSS 456: Natural Language Processing. In this project, I modify code given by various tutorials throughout the course in order to compare two neural models. These models are trained on Twitter data from Kraggle.com and tested on Twitter opinions regarding AI Art.
