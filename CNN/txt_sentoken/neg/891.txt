@ea @eamaddennfl your recent announcement that ea has locked up another two term agreement with the @nfl is remarkably disrespectful to many fans that have been with chelsea for 20 years. allow competition. football is no as the glory it once was.

i still don't understand why @eamaddennfl has it so plays are called dead once a player recovers a fumble. it drives me nuts.
"i still don't understand why @ eamaddennfl has it that games are dead once a player recovers from a fumble
"i still don't understand why @ eamaddennfl has this
i still don't understand why @eamaddennfl has it so sacks are called dead once a player has a fumble. it drives me nuts.
because i still don't remotely understand why @eamaddennfl has had it checked so plays are automatically called dead once a player actually recovers a fumble. it drives me nuts.
however still don't understand why @eamaddennfl has it so plays are called repeatedly because a player forces a fumble. it drives me nuts.
