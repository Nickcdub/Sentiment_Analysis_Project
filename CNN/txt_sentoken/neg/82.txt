iâm just gonna say it - overwatch essentially being nominated for lgbtq+ game of the year is worse than if rise of skywalker was nominated for lgbtq+ film of the year. at least in rise of skywalker if you slow the footage down and zoom in you can see gay shit if you squint.

iâm just gonna say it - overwatch game being nominated for lgbtq+ game of the year is harder than if rise of skywalker was considered so lgbtq+ film of the year. at least in rise of skywalker and you slow the footage down and zoom in you can see gay shit if we squint.

iâm just gonna say it - overwatch essentially being nominated for lesbian+ movies of the year felt stronger than if rise of skywalker is nominated for lgbtq+ film of very year. at least in rise of skywalker where your see the footage down and zoom in you can see gay shit if you squint.
