@treyarch any possibility of updating blackout to be cross platform? it doesnât even have to be on the new game. i think it would be a great idea for people not into warzone. a ton of bigger streamers also prefer it.

was @treyarch any possibility of updating blackout hardware to be cross platform? it doesn â t even have to be on the new simulation game. but i think it sure would be a great fun idea for people not into this warzone. a stuff ton of bigger paper streamers also would prefer it.
@treyarch any possibility of updating blackout to the cross platform? it doesnât even have to interact on the actual game. just think it would be a great idea for people not into warzone. got ton of cool streamers also support it.
