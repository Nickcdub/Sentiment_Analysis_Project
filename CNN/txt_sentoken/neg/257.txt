there was a major point in csgo where i desperately wanted to cheat because my team dropped me. this was a time where i was lem. i wanted to only go with pro thinking and guess the team i was on wasnt the best. but they dropped me and brought in some global players. after happening about once a week i lost everything hope in leaving csgo.
