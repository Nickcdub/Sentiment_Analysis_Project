"@ eamaddennfl it would be a shame to give the forwards of the x factor men's line
@eamaddennfl a wouldent hurts to give offensive line men x factors it could almost be like box analysis where how best get them into the zone is by not letting their quarterback get sacked or consecutive played without taking a loss of yards just throwing my opinion out there
14 @eamaddennfl it wouldent hurts to just give two offensive line men x these factors it then could almost be like momentum shift but how you get them into the zone is by not actually letting their quarterback get sacked easily or throw consecutive played without taking a complete loss of yards just throwing that my opinion out there
@eamaddennfl it wouldent hurts to give offensive line men x factors fucking with almost as subtle momentum shift knowing how you get them into comfort zone is like not letting their quarterback get sacked or consecutive played without taking intentional loss of yards just throwing my opinion out there
