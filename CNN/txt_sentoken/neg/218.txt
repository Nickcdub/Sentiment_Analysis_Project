"most amount of fun you can get out of a moba is booting up dota 2 for a first time to see what all the fuss is about â¦ then you rip its ass out when the valve guy turns sideways and stares into your soul. you can uninstall the game after that
"most amount of fun what you can get out of running a moba stadium is like booting up as dota 2 for the first time trying to see again what all the fuss is about and then you shit your fucking bones out when the valve guy turns around casually and stares into through your soul. you can uninstall the game after that
"most amount of fun you can squeeze out as a moba is booting up dota 2 for the first time to discover what all the fuss is for and only you check my bones out when the valve guy turns white or stares into your soul. you can uninstall the game after that
sad
